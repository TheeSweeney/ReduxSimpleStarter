Redux
	- predictable sate container for JS apps
		-wut?
	- separates data out from react.
	-a collection of all the data that makes up the app
		- both hard data, and meta data
	- React reps the views, and gets all it's data from redux
	- Redux stores all this data in a single central object
		- called the "state". a giant object that contains all the information relative to the app
	- having a good sense of how to design your state is critical when designing an app.
